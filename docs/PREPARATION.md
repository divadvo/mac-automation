# Preparation Guide

This guide covers pre-automation steps for setting up a new Mac and migrating from an old Mac.

## Format Old Mac

Before setting up your new Mac, prepare your old Mac for handoff:

### Export Current Configuration

Save your current Homebrew setup:

```bash
# Export installed formulae (command-line tools)
brew leaves --installed-on-request > formulae.txt

# Export installed casks (GUI applications)
brew list --cask -l1 > casks.txt
```

### Sign Out of Licensed Software

Before formatting your old Mac:

- **Adobe Creative Cloud**: Sign out to free up license activation
- **Apple Music/iTunes**: Deauthorize computer (Account â†’ Deauthorizations)
- Follow Apple's official guide: [What to do before you sell, give away, or trade in your Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT212749)
